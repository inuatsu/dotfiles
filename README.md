Get a cup of ‚òï or üçµ while waiting for setup completion. It takes about 5-10 minutes.

After setup finished, execute `source .zshrc` and you can try it out.

## Toolboxes

  - [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/): Base configuration
  - [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/): Plugin manager
  - [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig): LSP configuration

## Highlights

- In my setup I don't use Mason to install linters, formatters and language servers.
  Most of them are installed by mise or pnpm.
- When opening Python files, it searches appropriate project root
  and automatically activates the virtual environment of the project using
  [venv-selector.nvim](https://github.com/linux-cultist/venv-selector.nvim/tree/regexp)
  - LSP (pyright) uses the project's virtual environment
    to provide autocompletion and definition lookup
  - Linters (flake8/mypy/ruff) and formatters (black/isort/ruff)
    in the project's virtual environment are used if exists,
    otherwise global ones are used.
    If you don't install linters and formatters globally,
    only the ones installed in the virtual environment is used, that is,
    if you install black/flake8/isort/mypy in the virtual environment,
    only black/flake8/isort/mypy are used,
    and if you install mypy/ruff in the virtual environment,
    only mypy and ruff are used.
    - I customised in such a way,
      because in some project black/flake8/isort/mypy are used as linters/formatters,
      and in another project mypy/ruff are used.
    - Same strategy is applied to JavaScript/TypeScript linters/formatters (biome/eslint/prettier)
